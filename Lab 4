# Cybersecurity and Encryption

## Inforamtion Systems Security


If I worked at Amazon in the information system Security department and following the
The Information Triad this would effect the way I do my job in many various ways
First leg of the triad is Confidentiality, I would follow certain security measures
to make sure or to be confident that who I am giving information to the right person
Also at the same time information is not being given to an unauthorized person.
Integrity is the second side of the triad. What this would me to me if I was working is 
security at Amazon would I would and only would access privileged information if 
and only if, if it was work related. Lastly there is availibilty this means that there also 
has to be someone available to make the appropriate changes in a timely matter. This might 
mean for someone working a Amazon to have rotating shifts and hiring enough 
people to cover the 24/7 timeframe.

Authentication is acheived through 3 factors, something they know, something 
they have, or something they are. Three daily tasks that require authentication,
unlocking you phone, you must use a 4 or 8 digit code to unlock i, clocking into
work, some places requires you to use your finger print as a biometric authentication
and lastly using for zip-code to purchase things online with a debit or credit card.
The phone that requires a authentication after puting in your code, the phone could as
your to scan your finger print over the camera. Next clocking into work, the time clock
machine could make take a picture of your face with a timestamp. And Last the zipcode 
for the credit, maybe adding the question for your mother maiden name.


ACL is the for each information resource that an organization wants to manage, a list
of usres who have the ability to take specific actions can be created. ACL
are easy to maintain and understand. The disadvantage are that each information 
resource is managed separately, so adding a large amount of information would be 
difficult. Next there RBAC instead of giving user access rights to an information 
resource users are assigned to roles and then those rolse are assigned the access.
This allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying
administration. The disadvantage of this would be it would require more energy to 
to keep up.


When sending information it must be encryted, this is a security measure used to 
ensure only the authorized people are able to read it. Encryption is the process of 
encoding data upon it transmission or storage. This is done by a computer program.
which encode plain text that then needs to be transmitted. Then the reicpients receives 
the cipher text and decodes it. You would then need an encryption key. You would need 
two of them, public and private. The public key can be given to anyone who wishes
to send the recipient message.Each user simply needs one private and one public key
in order to secure messages. The private key is necessary in order to decrypt something
sent with the public key.

Explain why we need public key cryptography. 

We needed public cryptography in order to ensure confidentiality, also to ensure
security and data integrity. Also from the video Eve wont get the secret color.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption

Watch the videos "What is cryptography?" and "The Caesar cipher" 

Cryptography is using a cipher or virtual lock to scramble a code in order to 
send messages in private. 

### Cryptography

I had a simple message of "Helllo there" which translaed to "ifmmmp uifsf" I only
selected the 2 option.

Frequency Fingerprint Exploration with the 2 selection is "gsfrvfodz gjohfsqsjou
fyqmpsbujpo". This would be a different code if it was in a different language 
because each language has its own fingerprint. 

Polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher that uses substitutions of the alphabet.

After puting a messages into the Polyalphabetic Exploration it gave another code
that is hard to decode. I use the same message as before and it shifted the message 
even more.

## Brute-Force

Brute-force attach tries every possible decrpyion key for a cipher. 
Kerckhoff principle states that cipher should still be secure even if everyone know how the cipher
works and someone else has the ciphertext.
