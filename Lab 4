# Cybersecurity and Encryption

## Inforamtion Systems Security


If I worked at Amazon in the information system Security department and following the
The Information Triad this would effect the way I do my job in many various ways
First leg of the triad is Confidentiality, I would follow certain security measures
to make sure or to be confident that who I am giving information to the right person
Also at the same time information is not being given to an unauthorized person.
Integrity is the second side of the triad. What this would me to me if I was working is 
security at Amazon would I would and only would access privileged information if 
and only if, if it was work related. Lastly there is availibilty this means that there also 
has to be someone available to make the appropriate changes in a timely matter. This might 
mean for someone working a Amazon to have rotating shifts and hiring enough 
people to cover the 24/7 timeframe.

Authentication is acheived through 3 factors, something they know, something 
they have, or something they are. Three daily tasks that require authentication,
unlocking you phone, you must use a 4 or 8 digit code to unlock i, clocking into
work, some places requires you to use your finger print as a biometric authentication
and lastly using for zip-code to purchase things online with a debit or credit card.
The phone that requires a authentication after puting in your code, the phone could as
your to scan your finger print over the camera. Next clocking into work, the time clock
machine could make take a picture of your face with a timestamp. And Last the zipcode 
for the credit, maybe adding the question for your mother maiden name.


ACL is the for each information resource that an organization wants to manage, a list
of usres who have the ability to take specific actions can be created. ACL
are easy to maintain and understand. The disadvantage are that each information 
resource is managed separately, so adding a large amount of information would be 
difficult. Next there RBAC instead of giving user access rights to an information 
resource users are assigned to roles and then those rolse are assigned the access.
This allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying
administration. The disadvantage of this would be it would require more energy to 
to keep up.


When sending information it must be encryted, this is a security measure used to 
ensure only the authorized people are able to read it. Encryption is the process of 
encoding data upon it transmission or storage. This is done by a computer program.
which encode plain text that then needs to be transmitted. Then the reicpients receives 
the cipher text and decodes it. You would then need an encryption key. You would need 
two of them, public and private. The public key can be given to anyone who wishes
to send the recipient message.Each user simply needs one private and one public key
in order to secure messages. The private key is necessary in order to decrypt something
sent with the public key.

Explain why we need public key cryptography. 

We needed public cryptography in order to ensure confidentiality, also to ensure
security and data integrity. Also from the video Eve wont get the secret color.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption

Watch the videos "What is cryptography?" and "The Caesar cipher" 

Cryptography is using a cipher or virtual lock to scramble a code in order to 
send messages in private. 

### Cryptography

I had a simple message of "Helllo there" which translaed to "ifmmmp uifsf" I only
selected the 2 option.

Frequency Fingerprint Exploration with the 2 selection is "gsfrvfodz gjohfsqsjou
fyqmpsbujpo". This would be a different code if it was in a different language 
because each language has its own fingerprint. 

Polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher that uses substitutions of the alphabet.

After puting a messages into the Polyalphabetic Exploration it gave another code
that is hard to decode. I use the same message as before and it shifted the message 
even more.

## Brute-Force

Brute-force attach tries every possible decrpyion key for a cipher. 
Kerckhoff principle states that cipher should still be secure even if everyone know how the cipher
works and someone else has the ciphertext.


# Internet Architecture

## Internet Protocol

What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? 

IP address are the unique number assigned to every computer or device thats
connected to the internet. IPv4 is the pool of available unallocated addresses for 
the original IP, is usually a string of numbers between 0-255. IPv6 is a longer
address and written using hexadecimals, using colons to separate.


ICANN is theInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. It was started to help the governemnt
manage certain functions that maintain the internets core infrastructure. It maintinas the central repository
for IP addresses and helps coordinate the supply of IP addresses. It also manages the domain name system and root servers. 


TCP/IP is a collection of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet, this can also be used for private
networks.  It shows how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end commincations that show how it should be broken down
in packets, transmitted, routed, received and addressed.

IP addrees is the same as a phone number, and the port number would be like to a certian extension once the call has been answered. The client
in the TCP/IP connection is the computer that dial the phone and the server is the computer that is linstening for the call to come in. 

Review the section of the article aligning the post office with protocol stacks.  Why are layers important to changing technology? 

Layered protocol stacks, each level of the stack performs a particular function and communicates with the levels above and below it.
The layers protocols can be changed without affecting the other layers.


What types of applications run on the "application" layer?

HTTP,FTP,POP3,SMTP,SNMP

## Internet Security


HTTP is hypertext transfer protocol is the protocol that is used to see websites. HTTP is the sites application layer protocol works on the SSL
the computer web browser to identify itself and ask for a copy of the SSL and used to authenicate the website or to see if its trustworthy.

The procotols use to secure HTTP is to use HTTPS, this encrypts the data when transmitted. 

###  Internet Architecture

Why should you secure your browser? 

To stop spyware being installed or someone taking control of your computer.

Explain one of the risks described in the article.

Plug-in are applications intened for use in the web browers. Plug-ins can present many flaws, 
such as buffer overflows, and design flaws.

# Internet Programming

Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C? 

Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web, worte ths first world wide web server, httpd, and the first client program.
Wrote the first HTML. W3C was created to develop open standards sot eht web develops in a signle direction,


Pick a "standard" of your choice and explain why it is important.

Web Design and Applications developed the standard for building and Rendering Web pages. This is important because a consumer
would know what to expect when visiting and standard website. This is also important to know so when a person is building a website 
for a consumer they would know all the things they need for it to user friendly, such as graphics accessibility, etc.

#  HTML5 and CSS

I made a basic webiste for people who want a budget friendly wedding. I made the color pink and blue because I am currently, planning my 
wedding and those are my colors. I also set the link to got to the website Pinterest because that is the website where I get some 
budget friendly ideas. 

# HTML and XML

XML is different than HTML because it is used to store and transfer data. This is designed for data(storage and transfer)
, while HTML is designed show data. XML is also does not have predefined like HTML.


# Components of a URL 

 scheme - https
 domain -www.amazon.com 
 top level domain -.edu 
 default page- result of search  
 parameters-  no file path provided 
 anchor- specific location on a page
 
 # File Compression
 
 File is compression is when the packaging of a file to use less disk space. Software helps with taking many files
 and compress them into one file. 
 
 When compressed my folder it became smaller but not by much. The jpg folder is much smaller than the folder but is will also become
 smaller when compressed.
